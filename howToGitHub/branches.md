## Branches on GitHub
### What is a branch?
A branch is a workspace which don't affect the master branch (the branch which is ready to deploy).
In your own branch, you can try out new ideas. It won't be merged into the master branch until it's ready to get reviewed.
Therefore, you can delete all your changes by deleting your branch if the are not usable.
