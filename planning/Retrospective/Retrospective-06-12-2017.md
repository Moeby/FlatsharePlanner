| Type        | Description           | Solution            |
| ------------|-----------------------| --------------------|
| GLAD        | Marvin is happy that the planning worked out, everyone held up their part                      |                     |
| GLAD        | Nadja thinks everyone got used to scrum very quickly                     |                     |
| GLAD        | Nadja likes her own burndown chart                       |                     |
| GLAD        | Everyone loves Natalie's Mockups                      |                     |
| GLAD        | Tatyana is happy about the project topic
| SAD         | Everyone would have liked to start the implementation earlier                      | None, planning takes a lot of time in the beginning                    |
| SAD         | Marvin is sad that he did not have enough time to finish tickets assigned to him   | Should solve itself in the next sprint                    |
