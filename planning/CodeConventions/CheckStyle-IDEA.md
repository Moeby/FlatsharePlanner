## CheckStyle-IDEA Plugin

This plugin contains two default configuration files for style checks.
- SUN
- Google

It is possible to enable another configuration but it is hard to find one which fits and is possible to compile.
(maybe this one: [checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/da2bf5965502515635eedea39211b50b05ef7cb0/config/checkstyle_checks.xml) or this one [picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso/blob/master/checkstyle.xml))
